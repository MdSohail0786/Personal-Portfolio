            I am a passionate Software Engineer with expertise in Full-Stack
            Development, specializing in React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. I love
            building innovative, scalable, and user-centric applications that
            turn ideas into reality through clean and efficient code. Alongside
            my web development skills, I have a strong foundation in Data
            Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java, which helps me write
            optimized, high-performance solutions to complex problems. I believe
            mastering logic and system design is key to creating truly reliable
            software.

          <p className="text-lg">
            With hands-on experience in developing dynamic web applications and
            solving challenging programming problems, I continuously strive to
            improve my craft and stay updated with the latest technologies in
            the MERN ecosystem.
